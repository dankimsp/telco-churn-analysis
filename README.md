# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Business Problem
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company to identify at-risk customers and develop targeted retention strategies. The goal is to reduce customer churn and increase customer lifetime value through data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

## Key Business Questions
- What are the main factors driving customer churn?
- Which customer segments are most at risk of churning?
- What is the potential revenue impact of reducing churn by 10%?
- What targeted retention strategies should be implemented?

## Dataset
- **Source:** IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Size:** 7,043 customers
- **Features:** 21 variables including demographics, services, contract details, and churn status

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding customer behavior patterns and churn drivers
2. **Customer Segmentation:** K-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups
3. **Churn Prediction:** Machine learning models to predict customer churn risk
4. **Business Recommendations:** Actionable insights for retention strategies

## Technology Stack
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub
